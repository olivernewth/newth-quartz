This page explores various frameworks that can be used to structure feedback and problem-solving approaches in different contexts. Each framework provides a unique lens through which to analyze situations and formulate responses.

## STAR - Situation, Task, Action, Result

The STAR framework is widely used for answering behavioral-based interview questions. It helps provide a structured response that showcases experience and behavior in past situations.

- **S**ituation: Set the scene
- **T**ask: Describe the challenge or responsibility
- **A**ction: Explain the steps taken
- **R**esult: Share the outcome

**Example question:** "Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult decision."

## CIRCLES - Comprehend, Identify, Report, Cut, List, Evaluate, Summarize

The CIRCLES framework is particularly useful for product design questions. It provides a structured approach to understanding and solving problems.

- **C**omprehend situation
- **I**dentify customer
- **R**eport problem
- **C**ut through prioritization
- **L**ist solutions
- **E**valuate trade-offs
- **S**ummarize

**Example question:** "How would you improve the user experience of our mobile app?"

## AARM - Acquire, Activate, Retain, Monetize

The AARM framework is relevant for product strategy and growth questions. It demonstrates understanding of a product's lifecycle and how to optimize its performance over time.

- **A**cquire: Attract new users
- **A**ctivate: Engage users with core value
- **R**etain: Keep users coming back
- **M**onetize: Generate revenue from users

**Example question:** "How would you grow our user base and increase revenue?"

## SWOT - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

The SWOT framework is a classic tool for analyzing a product's position within its market. It helps demonstrate strategic thinking and ability to assess both internal and external factors that impact a product's success.

- **S**trengths: Internal positive factors
- **W**eaknesses: Internal negative factors
- **O**pportunities: External positive factors
- **T**hreats: External negative factors

**Example question:** "How would you assess our product's competitive position in the market?"

## RICE - Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort

The RICE framework is a valuable tool for prioritizing tasks or initiatives. It helps evaluate each option based on four key criteria:

- **R**each: How many people will this impact?
- **I**mpact: How much will it impact each person?
- **C**onfidence: How confident are we in our estimates?
- **E**ffort: How much time and resources will this require?

**Example question:** "How would you prioritize the items on our product roadmap?"

## GAME - Goals, Actions, Metrics, Experiments

The GAME framework is useful for developing and tracking product initiatives. It helps ensure that efforts are aligned with goals and that there's a clear way to measure success.

- **G**oals: What do we want to achieve?
- **A**ctions: What steps will we take?
- **M**etrics: How will we measure success?
- **E**xperiments: What tests can we run to validate our approach?

**Example question:** "How would you improve the engagement of our mobile app?"

## MECE - Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive

The MECE framework is a problem-solving approach that helps break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. The key is to ensure that each component is mutually exclusive (no overlap) and collectively exhaustive (covers all aspects of the problem).

**Example question:** "How would you analyze the decline in our e-commerce sales?"

You could break this down into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories such as:
- Product issues
- Pricing strategy
- Marketing effectiveness
- User experience
- Competition
- External factors

## Hook Model - Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, Investment

The Hook Model, popularized by Nir Eyal, is a framework for building habit-forming products. It outlines four key steps to engage users and keep them coming back:

- **T**rigger: What prompts the user to take action?
- **A**ction: What is the simplest behavior in anticipation of a reward?
- **V**ariable Reward: What does the user get for their action?
- **I**nvestment: What does the user put in that improves the product with use?

**Example question:** "How would you increase user retention for our subscription service?"

## JTBD - Jobs to Be Done

The Jobs to Be Done framework focuses on understanding the underlying motivations behind why customers "hire" a product to do a specific "job." By framing customer needs in terms of the jobs they are trying to accomplish, you can develop solutions that better meet those needs.

**Example question:** "How would you improve our customer onboarding process?"

A JTBD approach might uncover jobs such as:
- "I want to get up and running quickly so I can start using the product right away."
- "I want to feel confident that I'm using the product correctly and getting the most value from it."
- "I want to customize the product to fit my specific needs and preferences."

## 5 Whys

The 5 Whys framework is a simple but effective technique for getting to the root cause of a problem. It involves asking "why" five times in succession, each time drilling down further into the underlying reasons behind the problem.

**Example question:** "Our user retention rates have been declining. How would you diagnose and address this issue?"

By asking "why" five times, you can uncover the fundamental issues contributing to the problem and develop targeted solutions to address them.
