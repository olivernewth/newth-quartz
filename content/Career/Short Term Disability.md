Short term disability (STD) insurance provides income protection if you become temporarily unable to work due to injury, illness, or pregnancy. You typically pay premiums through payroll deductions.

## Key Points

- Replaces a portion of your income (usually 60-70%) for a limited time period (typically 3-6 months)
- Has a waiting/elimination period before benefits begin (often 7-14 days)
- Benefit amount based on severity of disability and inability to perform job duties

For more information specific to California, you can visit the [California State Disability Insurance (SDI) page](https://www.edd.ca.gov/disability/).

## Required Documentation

- [ ] Medical documentation from healthcare provider detailing:
  - [ ] Nature and severity of condition
  - [ ] Expected duration of disability
  - [ ] Treatment plan
- [ ] Completed claim forms from employer
- [ ] Proof of income/earnings history
- [ ] Authorization for release of medical information

## Benefit Determination

Insurance providers assess:

- Physical limitations and restrictions
- Job requirements and essential duties
- Medical evidence and physician statements
- Ability to perform modified/alternative work

The more your condition impacts core job functions, the higher percentage of income replacement you may receive, up to the policy maximum.
