title: Career Journey
description: My path through tech, leadership, and continuous learning
---

Welcome to my career notes! This is where I document my journey through tech leadership, collecting hard-won lessons and useful frameworks along the way. Think of it as my personal "captain's log" for navigating the wild seas of professional growth.

## Current Focus Areas ðŸŽ¯

### Engineering & Architecture

I'm diving deep into systems architecture lately, particularly:

- [[System Design]] - Learning to build systems that scale (and don't wake me up at 3am)
- [[Architecture Patterns]] - Because I'm tired of reinventing wheels
- [[API Design Principles]] - The art of interfaces that don't make future-me angry

### Leadership Growth

Currently working on:

- [[Building Strong Teams]] - Real strategies that worked (and some that definitely didn't)
- [[Tech Communication]] - Making complex ideas clear without losing the nuance
- [[Decision Frameworks]] - Tools for making better choices under pressure

### Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

Because "future you" is really "present you" who forgot everything:

- [[Documentation Strategy]] - Making docs people actually want to read
- [[Technical Writing]] - Clear explanations of complex things
- [[Teaching Others]] - Because teaching is learning twice

## Growth Tracking ðŸ“ˆ

I use a few key tools to stay focused and measure progress:

- [[Career Goals|Where I'm Headed]] - My professional north star
- [[Skills Matrix|Skills Inventory]] - What I know (and what I need to learn)
- [[Learning Log]] - Weekly progress notes and reflections

## Mentorship Corner ðŸŒ±

Lessons from both sides of the mentorship journey:

- [[Mentorship Lessons]] - What I'm learning as both mentor and mentee
- [[Mentoring Frameworks]] - Approaches that actually work
- [[Mentorship Sessions]] - Private notes from 1:1s

## Resource Library ðŸ“š

Some of my most-referenced resources:

- [[The Managers Path Notes]] - Great book, messy reality
- [[Technical Papers]] - Research worth revisiting
- [[Conference Notes]] - Key takeaways from talks
