There are a number of product frameworks that are useful for product managers. I have listed the main ones below that I regularly use.

## STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

This is a structured approach for answering behavioral interview questions.

**Components**:

- **Situation:** Set the context
- **Task:** Describe your responsibility
- **Action:** Explain what you did
- **Result:** Share the outcome

**Example Question**: "Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult decision."

## CIRCLES (Comprehend, Identify, Report, Cut, List, Evaluate, Summarize)

**Purpose**: Structured approach for product design questions.

**Components**:
1. Comprehend situation
2. Identify customer
3. Report problem
4. Cut through prioritization
5. List solutions
6. Evaluate trade-offs
7. Summarize

**Example Question**: "How would you improve the user experience of our mobile app?"

## AARM (Acquire, Activate, Retain, Monetize)

**Purpose**: Framework for product strategy and growth.

**Components**:
1. Acquire: Attract new users
2. Activate: Engage users with core value
3. Retain: Keep users coming back
4. Monetize: Generate revenue from users

**Example Question**: "How would you grow our user base and increase revenue?"

## SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)

**Purpose**: Analyze a product's market position.

**Components**:
- Strengths: Internal positive factors
- Weaknesses: Internal negative factors
- Opportunities: External positive factors
- Threats: External negative factors

**Example Question**: "How would you assess our product's competitive position in the market?"

## RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)

**Purpose**: Prioritize tasks or initiatives.

**Components**:
- Reach: Number of people affected
- Impact: How much it matters
- Confidence: Certainty of success
- Effort: Resources required

**Example Question**: "How would you prioritize the items on our product roadmap?"

## GAME (Goals, Actions, Metrics, Experiments)

**Purpose**: Develop and track product initiatives.

**Components**:
1. Goals: Define objectives
2. Actions: Plan steps to achieve goals
3. Metrics: Determine success measures
4. Experiments: Test hypotheses

**Example Question**: "How would you improve the engagement of our mobile app?"

## MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

**Purpose**: Break down complex problems into manageable components.

**Components**:
- Mutually Exclusive: No overlap between categories
- Collectively Exhaustive: Covers all aspects of the problem

**Example Question**: "How would you analyze the decline in our e-commerce sales?"

## Hook Model (Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, Investment)

**Purpose**: Build habit-forming products.

**Components**:
1. Trigger: Internal or external cue to action
2. Action: Simplest behavior in anticipation of reward
3. Variable Reward: Satisfy user's need while leaving them wanting more
4. Investment: User invests time, data, effort, social capital, or money

**Example Question**: "How would you increase user retention for our subscription service?"

## JTBD (Jobs to Be Done)

**Purpose**: Understand underlying customer motivations.

**Key Concept**: Customers "hire" products to do specific "jobs" in their lives.

**Example Question**: "How would you improve our customer onboarding process?"

## 5 Whys

**Purpose**: Identify root causes of problems.

**Process**: Ask "why" five times in succession, each time probing deeper.

**Example Question**: "Our user retention rates have been declining. How would you diagnose and address this issue?"
