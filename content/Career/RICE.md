RICE is a scoring model that helps product teams prioritize features and initiatives objectively.

## Framework Components

### Reach
- Number of users/customers affected
- Time period measurement (usually quarterly)
- Usage frequency consideration

### Impact
- Effect on individual users
- Scale typically 0.25 to 3.0
- Minimal (0.25x)
- Moderate (0.5x)
- High (1x)
- Massive (3x)

### Confidence
- Certainty level in estimates
- Percentage scale (0-100%)
- High (100%)
- Medium (80%)
- Low (50%)
- Minimal (20%)

### Effort
- Estimated person-months
- Team resources required
- Implementation complexity

## Calculation
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

## Application

1. **Feature Prioritization**
   - New features
   - Improvements
   - Bug fixes

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Team assignments
   - Sprint planning
   - Roadmap development

3. **Communication**
   - Stakeholder alignment
   - Team transparency
   - Decision justification

## Best Practices
- Use consistent scoring criteria
- Document assumptions
- Review scores periodically
- Adjust based on learnings
