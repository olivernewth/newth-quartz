### General Guidance


**Explain** - We want to understand how you think, so describe your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember, we're not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable.

**Clarify** - Many questions will be intentionally open-ended to provide insight into what categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. We're looking to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification.

**Improve** - Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It's worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts on a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve on it â€” just let the interviewer know that's what you're doing and why.

**Practice** - Stay current with tech trends and innovations by reading relevant news articles and blogs. Understand who your users are. Become comfortable working with [[Product Frameworks]]. Integrate these topics in mock interviews.
