The FITT Principle is a fundamental framework for exercise program design, essential for creating balanced and effective workout plans. This systematic approach helps optimize training outcomes while preventing injury and overtraining.

## Components
- **Frequency**: How often to exercise, based on your goals and recovery needs. Balance training frequency with adequate rest to allow for proper adaptation.

- **Intensity**: The level of effort during exercise, measured through [[Mental Health|perceived exertion]] or heart rate monitoring. Intensity should progressively increase as fitness improves.

- **Time**: Duration of each exercise session. This varies based on fitness level, exercise type, and available time. Quality of movement takes precedence over duration.

- **Type**: The specific exercises or activities chosen, which should align with your goals and preferences. Incorporate variety to maintain motivation and target different aspects of fitness.

## Usage
Apply the FITT principle to systematically design and adjust workout programs. Regular assessment and modification of these variables ensures continued progress while minimizing plateaus and maintaining [[Health/index|overall health]].
