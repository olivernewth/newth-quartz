- **Measurable**: Include concrete metrics to track progress (e.g. weight, reps, distance)
- **Achievable**: Set realistic goals based on current fitness level and resources
- **Relevant**: Align with broader [[Health/index|health priorities]] and lifestyle goals
- **Time-bound**: Establish clear deadlines and milestones for accountability
