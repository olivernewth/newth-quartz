Mobility - the ability to move freely and easily - is fundamental to overall [[Health/index|physical health]] and fitness. By developing and maintaining good mobility, we can enhance our quality of life and physical capabilities.

## Types of Mobility Work
- Dynamic stretching involves active movements that prepare the body for exercise
- Static stretching enhances overall flexibility through held positions
- Foam rolling helps release muscle tension and improves tissue quality 
- Joint mobilization exercises target specific movement patterns

## Benefits
- Prevents injuries by improving movement quality
- Enhances athletic and daily performance
- Develops better posture and body awareness
- Reduces chronic pain and discomfort
- Increases range of motion

## Mobility Assessments
- Movement pattern screening reveals limitations and asymmetries
- Range of motion testing quantifies joint flexibility
- Posture analysis identifies areas needing focused work

## Mobility Routines
- Begin each day with gentle mobility exercises
- Prepare for workouts with dynamic movement patterns
- Cool down with mobility work to aid recovery
- Counter prolonged sitting with targeted mobility breaks

## Related Areas

- Good mobility habits complement [[Learning/Flow|flow state]] activities

> [!tip] Daily Practice
> Focus on brief, consistent mobility work throughout each day rather than infrequent longer sessions. Even 5-10 minutes can make a difference.
