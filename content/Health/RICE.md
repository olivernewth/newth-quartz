RICE is a first-aid protocol used for managing acute injuries, particularly soft tissue injuries like sprains and strains. The acronym stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation - four key components that help reduce pain and swelling while promoting healing.

## Components

1. Rest

   - Avoid using the injured area
   - Prevent further injury
   - Allow the healing process to begin

2. Ice

   - Apply cold therapy for 15-20 minutes at a time
   - Repeat every 2-3 hours
   - Helps reduce swelling and pain

3. Compression

   - Use an elastic bandage to provide gentle pressure
   - Wrap from the furthest point from the heart
   - Avoid wrapping too tightly

4. Elevation
   - Raise the injured area above heart level
   - Maintain elevation when possible
   - Helps reduce swelling through gravity

## Implementation

- Begin RICE protocol as soon as possible after injury
- Continue for 24-48 hours
- Monitor the injury for signs of improvement
- Seek professional medical care for severe injuries
