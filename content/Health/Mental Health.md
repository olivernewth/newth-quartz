   - Understanding and managing emotions
   - Developing healthy coping mechanisms
   - Building resilience

2. Stress Management
   - Practicing mindfulness and meditation
   - Regular exercise and physical activity
   - Maintaining work-life balance

3. Social Connections
   - Building and maintaining relationships
   - Effective communication
   - Setting healthy boundaries

4. Self-Care
   - Getting adequate sleep
   - Maintaining proper nutrition
   - Engaging in enjoyable activities

5. Professional Support
   - Therapy and counseling when needed
   - Understanding treatment options
   - Regular mental health check-ups

Remember that mental health is equally important as physical health, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
