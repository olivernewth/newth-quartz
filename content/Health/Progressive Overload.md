Progressive overload is a key principle in exercise and fitness training where the demands placed on the body are gradually increased over time to continually improve strength, endurance, and overall fitness.

## Core Concepts

- Gradual increase in workout intensity
- Systematic progression of training variables
- Focus on sustainable long-term improvements
- Balance between challenge and recovery

## Implementation Methods

- Increasing weight/resistance
- Adding more repetitions
- Extending set duration
- Reducing rest periods
- Improving movement quality
- Increasing workout frequency

## Benefits

- Continued strength gains
- Improved muscular endurance
- Enhanced athletic performance
- Reduced training plateaus
- Better adaptation response

## Application Guidelines

- Start with manageable increases
- Monitor recovery between sessions
- Track progress using [[Workout Log]]
- Adjust based on [[RPE|Rate of Perceived Exertion]]
- Follow [[Health/FITT|FITT Principle]] guidelines

## Common Mistakes

- Increasing load too quickly
- Insufficient recovery time
- Inconsistent progression
- Poor form/technique
- Neglecting deload periods
