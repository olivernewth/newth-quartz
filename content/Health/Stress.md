**Stress** affects me both mentally and physically. While I've learned that some stress helps me perform better, I need active strategies to prevent it from becoming overwhelming.

## My Stress Signals
- **Physical**: Tight shoulders, shallow breathing, headaches
- **Mental**: Racing thoughts, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness  
- **Emotional**: Irritability, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed
- **Behavioral**: Poor sleep, stress eating, procrastination

## What Works For Me
- **Morning Meditation**: 10 mins using Headspace app
- **Quick Resets**: 4-7-8 breathing when feeling tense
- **Movement**: Daily walk + 3x weekly strength training
- **Evening Routine**: Gentle stretching before bed

## My Support System
- **Professional**: Monthly check-ins with therapist
- **Personal**: Weekly calls with close friends
- **Work**: Regular 1:1s with manager about workload
- **Home**: Quiet space for decompression

## My Tracking System
I use [[Health/Stress Management|my stress journal]] to track:
- Daily stress level (1-10)
- Key triggers and patterns
- What helped / didn't help
- Sleep quality correlation

## Prevention Strategy
Using [[Frameworks/GROW|GROW]] framework for my stress management:
1. **Goal**: Maintain stress below 7/10
2. **Reality**: Currently peaks at 8-9 during projects
3. **Options**: Better boundaries, delegation, breaks
4. **Way Forward**: implementing structured breaks
