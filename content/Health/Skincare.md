### Daily Routine

For face products, use [[non-comedogenic]] products to ensure that they do not block pores and contribute to acne formation.

- [ ] Apply Sunscreen 1/day for [[Sun Protection]]
- [ ] Use Face moisturizer 1/day to maintain skin hydration
- [ ] Apply Tretinoin cream (10%) every 1-2 days for anti-aging benefits
- [ ] Use Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 1/day for acne treatment
- [ ] Brush teeth 2x/day as part of overall oral hygiene
- [ ] Wash face 1x/day to remove dirt and excess oil
- [ ] Use Mouthwash 1x/day for additional oral care
- [ ] Take Daily medications as prescribed

### Weekly Routine

- [ ] Exfoliate 1-2 times per week to remove dead skin cells
- [ ] Apply a hydrating or clarifying mask 1/week
  - Hydrating masks are great for dry skin, while clay or charcoal masks can help remove excess oil from oily skin types.

### If I get a breakout

- [ ] Wash with facial cleanser to remove impurities
- [ ] Apply ice for 5-10 minutes a few times through the day to reduce redness and swelling, a technique known as cryotherapy for skin
- [ ] Wrap overnight with Hydrocolloid Bandages to ensure that they stay in a moist, sealed environment for optimal healing
