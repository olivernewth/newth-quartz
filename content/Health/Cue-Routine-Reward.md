The Cue-Routine-Reward cycle, also known as the "habit loop", is a fundamental framework for understanding and changing habits.

## Components
- **Cue**: The trigger that initiates the habit
- **Routine**: The actual behavior or action
- **Reward**: The benefit gained from the behavior

## Identifying Your Habit Loop
1. Notice the cues that trigger habits
2. Observe the routine that follows
3. Identify the reward you receive
4. Document patterns over time

## Changing Habits
- Keep the same cue and reward
- Replace the routine with a new behavior
- Start with small, manageable changes
- Track progress using [[Habit Tracking]]

## Common Applications
- Exercise habits
- Eating patterns
- Sleep routines
- Work productivity
- Stress management

> [!tip] Focus on Systems
> Rather than focusing solely on goals, develop systems and routines that make good habits inevitable.
