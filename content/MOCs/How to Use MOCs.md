Maps of Content (MOCs) are navigation hubs that connect related knowledge areas. They help you build an interconnected personal knowledge graph.

## Core Concepts

- **Structure** - Organize information into logical topic clusters
- **Connections** - Create clear pathways between related ideas
- **Overview** - Provide high-level views of knowledge domains
- **Access** - Enable quick retrieval of key information

## Implementation

- Start with foundational areas like [[Learning/index|Learning]] and [[Career/index|Career]]
- Use descriptive link text that adds context
- Maintain consistent MOC formatting
- Update regularly as knowledge grows

## Best Practices

- Keep each MOC focused and well-scoped
- Add brief descriptions for linked content
- Use tags for cross-referencing
- Follow [[MOCs/MOC Best Practices|MOC Best Practices]]

## Organization

- Group related content thematically
- Use clear heading hierarchies
- Include metadata via tags and icons
- Apply [[Knowledge Organization]] principles

## Navigation Flow

1. Begin at [[MOCs/index|main hub]]
2. Browse topic MOCs
3. Follow contextual links
4. Use tag navigation

> [!tip] Review Regularly
> Schedule MOC reviews to maintain effective navigation as your knowledge base expands.
