When writing content, structure it like a personal knowledge graph with:
Clear, atomic concepts that link naturally to each other
Concise, direct language like every.to
Bullet points for easy scanning
Examples that bridge concepts
Key terms highlighted using code or bold formatting
Natural connection points marked with [[wiki-style links]]
Where possible, link to existing material
Link to external content as well when possible
Do not add related resources to the end of the page
The page format should be as follows in markdown - if the frontmatter is not present, please add it:
---
title: TITLE
---
CONTENT
