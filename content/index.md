This is my place where I share all aspects of my life. It's a [[Living document]], so don't expect it to be perfect :) 

## Current Focus Areas

- [[Interview Preparation]] - Approaches to preparing for interviews
- [[Gardening Principles]] - Learning how to maintain a garden
- [[Reading List]] - Getting back into reading both fiction and non-fiction
- [[Tools]] - Documenting tools that I'm finding super useful and why
