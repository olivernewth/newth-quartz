{"hypotheticals":["Notes > Personal > Quick Thoughts > Daily Reflections > Morning Pages > March 15: \n\nNeed to get better organized with my note-taking system. Currently have scattered thoughts across different apps and notebooks. Main priorities:\n\n- Consolidate everything into one digital system\n- Create consistent folder structure\n- Add proper tags and metadata\n- Set up regular review schedule\n\nStarting to see the value in building a proper second brain. Random ideas and insights keep slipping through the cracks. Would be so much more effective if I could:\n\n- Capture thoughts quickly when they occur\n- Find old notes easily when needed  \n- Make connections between different topics\n- Turn rough notes into usable content\n\n☐ Research note-taking methodologies (Zettelkasten, P.A.R.A, etc)\n☐ Choose primary note-taking app\n☐ Import existing notes\n☐ Set up basic folder structure\n☐ Create workflow for regular maintenance\n\nThis feels like a worthy investment of time. Future self will thank me for getting organized now rather than letting the chaos continue to grow."]}
