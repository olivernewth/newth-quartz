## AI & Machine Learning
- Deep learning models becoming more accessible through APIs and cloud services
  - [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/)
  - [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform)
- Focus on practical applications like:
  - Code completion
  - Image generation
  - Natural language processing
- Key considerations for implementation:
  - Model selection
  - Data quality
  - Ethical usage
  - Cost optimization

## Cloud & Infrastructure 
- Shift toward serverless and managed services
- Container orchestration with [[Kubernetes]]
  - [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
- Infrastructure as code using tools like:
  - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
  - [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
  - [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)

## Privacy & Security
- Zero trust security model adoption
  - [NIST Zero Trust](https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture)
- End-to-end encryption becoming standard
- Data minimization practices
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Mobile & Cross-Platform
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) for unified experiences
  - [web.dev PWA Guide](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)
- Cross-platform frameworks like:
