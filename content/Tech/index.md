## Current Obsessions

### System Design Deep Dives

I keep having to relearn this stuff, so I'm finally writing it down properly:

- [[Architecture Patterns]] - The good, the bad, and the "it depends"
- [[Scalability Principles]] - Because everything breaks at scale
- [[Database Design]] - Hard-won lessons about data
- [[API Design]] - Making future-me's life easier

### Dev Practices I'm Learning From

(Usually after making the mistakes myself)

- [[Code Quality]] - Beyond "clean code"
- [[Testing Strategies]] - Because I'm tired of 3am production fixes
- [[CI/CD Patterns]] - Automation > manual work
- [[Documentation Best Practices]] - Future me will thank present me

### Tools I Actually Use

- [[Cloud Platforms]] - AWS, but I'm curious about others
- [[Development Tools]] - My actual setup, not just theory
- [[Programming Languages]] - Strong opinions, weakly held
- [[Framework Comparisons]] - What works when (and why)

## Learning Journey

### Current Focus

- Getting better at distributed systems design
- Learning from production incidents
- Building more resilient systems

### Resources I'm Using

- [[Tech Books|Books That Actually Helped]]
- [[Conference Notes|Things I Learned at Conferences]]
- [[Learning Resources|Stuff Worth Reading]]

## Project Notes

- [[Architecture Decisions|Why I Built Things This Way]]
- [[Implementation Patterns|Patterns That Worked]]
- [[Performance Optimizations|Making Things Fast(er)]]
