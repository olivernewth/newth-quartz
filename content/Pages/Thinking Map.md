# Thinking Map

I am in the process of learning how I likely have [[Autism]] and how this is both beneficial and detrimental at times. I would like to get into a state of [[Flow]] more often, where I can get deeply ingrained in a task.

### Learning to Learn

[[Learning Techniques]]

[[Learning through Synthesis]]

[[Distractions]]

[[Autism and Learning]]

### The Three Headspaces of PKMs

1. [[Atlas]] (Knowledge-Based)

2. [[Efforts]] (Action-based)

3. Calendar (Time-based) 

We want to limit how much [[Context Switching]] is happening between these, so we can stay in [[Flow]].

### Ideating with the ARC Framework

1. Add: Write down ideas and thoughts that you have, and apply the #New label

2. Relate:If the idea is valuable, the #New label should be removed, and it should be connected to other thoughts.

3. Communicate

Typical note taking focuses too much on Add - you have to spend more time on 

### **Growth Stages in Digital Gardens**

1. #Seedling - Define this early stage, focusing on exploring and gathering diverse ideas without a clear direction.

2. #Budding - Describe the transition from seedlings, where certain ideas begin to show promise and require further exploration.

3. #Evergreen - Final stage, it is now in a detailed and thoughtful state, though it is never "finished".

Areas to be developed more are tagged with #Focus.
