I'm exploring how [[Autism]] affects my learning and productivity. My goal is to achieve [[Flow]] more consistently, enabling deeper task engagement.

## Core Systems

### The Three Spaces of Knowledge

1. [[Learning Atlas|Atlas]] (Knowledge-Based)

   - How I organize what I know
   - Making information findable
   - Building useful connections

2. Action-based

   - Project management
   - Task tracking
   - Daily workflows

3. Time-based
   - Calendar systems
   - Time blocking
   - Energy management

## Current Experiments

### Learning Techniques

- Testing different note-taking approaches
- Exploring spaced repetition
- Building better review systems

### Focus & Flow

- Managing [[ADHD]] impacts
- Creating optimal environments
- Reducing context switching

### Knowledge Synthesis

- Connecting ideas across domains
- Building mental models
- Creating useful abstractions

## Tools & Methods

### Current Stack

- [[Obsidian]] for knowledge management
- [[Todoist]] for tasks
- [[Calendly]] for time management

### Frameworks

- [[Progressive Summarization]] for processing
- [[Zettelkasten]] for connections
- [[PARA]] for organization

> [!note] Work in Progress
> This system is always evolving. I document changes in my [[Learning Log]].
