I'm exploring how my likely [[Autism]] affects my learning and productivity. My goal is to achieve a state of [[Flow]] more often, enabling deep task engagement.

## Core Concepts

### The Three Headspaces of PKMs
1. [[Learning/Atlas|Atlas]] (Knowledge-Based): A system for organizing and accessing your knowledge base.
2. [[Efforts]] (Action-based)
3. [[Calendar]] (Time-based) 

We aim to minimize [[Context Switching]] between these headspaces to maintain [[Flow]].

### Learning to Learn
- [[Learning Techniques]]
- [[Learning through Synthesis]]
- [[Managing Distractions]]
- [[Autism and Learning]]: Exploring the unique learning styles and challenges associated with autism spectrum disorders.

### Ideating with the ARC Framework
1. **Add**: Write down ideas and thoughts, applying the #New label
2. **Relate**: Remove the #New label for valuable ideas and connect them to other thoughts
3. **Communicate**: Share and discuss your ideas

> Note: Traditional note-taking often overemphasizes the "Add" step. Focus more on relating and communicating ideas.

## Digital Gardening

### Growth Stages in Digital Gardens
1. #Seedling: Early stage, exploring diverse ideas without clear direction
2. #Budding: Transitional stage, where promising ideas require further exploration
3. #Evergreen: Detailed and thoughtful state, though never truly "finished"

Areas needing development are tagged with #Focus.

### Practical Tips for Cultivating Your Digital Garden
- **Starting Your Digital Garden**: Explore [[Digital Garden Tools]], platforms, and initial content strategies
- **Maintaining Growth**: Regularly update, encourage idea development, and link between concepts
- **Engaging with the Community**: Share your garden and collaborate with others for feedback

### Incorporating [[Zettelkasten]] for Improved Understanding
The Zettelkasten method can be a valuable tool when combined with a [[Digital Garden]], creating a comprehensive [[Knowledge Management Systems|knowledge management system]] through interconnected notes.

## Knowledge Management Systems

### Building a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) System
1. [[PKM and Idea Emergence]]
2. [[Growing Value in Notes]]
3. [[Knowledge Management Systems]]
4. [[Customizing Your PKM System]]
5. [[Processing New Information]]
6. [[Sharing Knowledge]]

For more details, see [[Knowledge Management Systems]].
