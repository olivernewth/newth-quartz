I'm exploring how [[Autism]] affects my learning and productivity. My goal is to achieve [[Flow]] more consistently, enabling deeper task engagement.

## Core Concepts

### The Three Spaces of Personal Knowledge Management
1. [[Learning-Atlas|Atlas]] (Knowledge-Based): A system for organizing and accessing your knowledge base.
2. Action-based: Managing active projects and tasks
3. Time-based: Calendar and scheduling

We aim to minimize context switching between these spaces to maintain [[Flow]].

### Learning to Learn
- Learning techniques and strategies
- Synthesizing knowledge effectively
- Managing distractions
- Understanding autism's impact on learning styles and challenges

### Ideating with the ARC Framework
1. **Add**: Capture ideas and thoughts, applying the #New label
2. **Relate**: Remove the #New label from valuable ideas and connect them to existing concepts
3. **Communicate**: Share and discuss your insights

> Note: While traditional note-taking emphasizes capturing information, true learning comes from relating and communicating ideas.

## Digital Gardening

### Growth Stages in Digital Gardens
1. #Seedling: Initial exploration of diverse ideas
2. #Budding: Promising concepts requiring deeper investigation
