# Atomic Notes

Atomic notes are the fundamental building blocks of the [[zettels/zettelkasten method]]. They are:

1. **Self-contained**: Each note should express a single, complete idea.
2. **Concise**: Typically no longer than a paragraph or two.
3. **Interconnected**: Linked to other related notes through explicit connections.
4. **Contextual**: Include enough context to be understood on their own.
5. **Evergreen**: Designed to be relevant and re-visitable over time

Key benefits of atomic notes:

- Facilitate non-linear thinking
- Encourage deeper understanding through synthesis
- Support flexible knowledge organization
- Aid in discovering new connections between ideas

To create effective atomic notes:

1. Capture ideas as they come
2. Refine and break down complex thoughts
3. Establish meaningful links between notes
4. Regularly review and update your note network

> [!tip] Remember
> The power of atomic notes lies not just in their individual content, but in the network of connections they form.
