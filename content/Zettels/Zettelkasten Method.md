# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten Method is a personal knowledge management system developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. It's designed to enhance learning, creativity, and productivity through the creation and connection of [[Zettels/Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]].

Key principles of the Zettelkasten Method:

1. **Atomicity**: Each note contains one main idea ([[Atomic Notes]])
2. **Autonomy**: Notes should be self-contained and understandable on their own
3. **Linking**: Connect notes to create a network of ideas
4. **Emergence**: New insights arise from the connections between notes

Types of notes in a Zettelkasten:
- [[fleeting]]: Quick, temporary capture of ideas #fleeting
- [[tags/literature]]: Summaries and key points from external sources
- [[tags/permanent]]: Refined, original thoughts integrated into your knowledge network

Benefits of using Zettelkasten:
- Improves retention and understanding
- Facilitates non-linear thinking and creativity
- Supports long-term knowledge accumulation
- Aids in writing and project development

To implement Zettelkasten:
1. Capture ideas as they come ([[Fleeting Notes]])
2. Process and refine notes regularly
3. Create meaningful connections between notes
4. Review and update your note network

> [!tip] Remember
> The true power of Zettelkasten lies not in collecting information, but in creating connections and generating new insights.
