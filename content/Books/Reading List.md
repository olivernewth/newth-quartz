### 2024

I have been trying to get back into reading this year, and one of the main [[Tools]] that I have found invaluable has been a Kobo Reader. It makes it super easy to get lost in a book, especially as you can hide things like page count. It's also not tied into an upselling ecosystem anywhere near as much as a Kindle.

- [[The Housemaids Secret]] by Freida McFadden ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Gripping domestic thriller with clever twists
- [[First Lie Wins]] by Ashley Elston ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Taut psychological suspense
- [[The Remains of the Day]] by Kazuo Ishiguro ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Masterful exploration of memory and duty
- [[The Winner]] by Teddy Wayne ⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Sharp social commentary
- [[Presence]] by Amy Cuddy ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Transformative insights on personal power
- [[Something in the Water]] by Catherine Steadman ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Compelling moral thriller
- [[None of This Is True]] by Lisa Jewell ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Brilliant meta-mystery
- [[Yellowface]] by R.F. Kuang ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Provocative literary satire
- [[Never Let Me Go]] by Kazuo Ishiguro - Currently reading this haunting sci-fi meditation
