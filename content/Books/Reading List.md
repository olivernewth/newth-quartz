title: Reading List 2024

I have been trying to get back into reading this year. One of the invaluable [[Tools]] I've discovered is a Kobo Reader - it enables deep immersion in books by allowing you to hide distracting elements like page counts. It offers a more focused reading experience compared to the upsell-heavy Kindle ecosystem.
