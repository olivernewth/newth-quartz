title: Progressive Summarization
---

Progressive Summarization is a note-taking technique developed by [[Tiago Forte]] that focuses on **layered highlighting**. I use it to make my notes more actionable and easier to find later.

## Core Concepts

- **Layer 0**: Save the original content exactly as I found it
- **Layer 1**: Bold the parts that catch my attention (aim for ≤10%)
- **Layer 2**: Highlight the absolute key insights (≤10% of bold)
- **Layer 3**: Write a quick summary in my own words
- **Layer 4**: Create something new from the insights

## Why I Use It

- Helps me find important stuff without re-reading everything
- Keeps the full context while surfacing key points
- Makes my notes actually useful for future projects
- Fits naturally into my [[Knowledge Management]] system
- Perfect for [[Just-In-Time Learning]] when I need it

## My Implementation Tips

- I only summarize notes I actually come back to
- I bold what resonates with me personally
- Try to keep each layer to ~10% of the previous
- Layer 3 is where I add my own insights and connections
- Layer 4 is great for blog posts and project ideas

## My Workflow

1. Save interesting content (Layer 0)
2. Bold key parts during first read
3. Highlight the game-changers on second pass
4. Write summary when needed for specific projects
5. Transform into new content when inspiration strikes
